Upon entering the Computer Engineering program at UFBA (Federal University of Bahia), where I joined the junior computing company TITAN, I was able to engage in the market by developing applications both on the front-end and back-end, working with TypeScript, with a greater focus on the back-end. What sets me apart is not only my technical proficiency but also my passion for staying updated on market trends and adopting best practices to deliver optimal results.",
